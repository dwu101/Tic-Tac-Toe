# Tic-Tac-Toe
A digital version of, you guessed it, Tic-Tac-Toe. It is Player v Computer. This game uses a React.js frontend that sends user moves to the Flask backend. 
The backend will decide the computer's next move using a trained model and return the move to the frontend, where it will be displayed. You'll need some luck, 
as the computer will always generate the best move.
